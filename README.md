## Haxe-React Todo App

Implementing react-redux's demo from [here](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html#implementing-container-components) with haxe-redux and its [PR#6](https://github.com/elsassph/haxe-redux/pull/6) adding support for High Order Components.

This project will also be used to add more features to haxe-redux, like for example support for [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect).
